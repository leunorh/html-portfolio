<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Leunor Hoda, born in Prishtina , a city in a small country in Balkan called Kosovo.</p>

<p>At a young age I found an inner desire for computers and the internet in general. While other kids enjoyed playing in outside with friends and toys I was experimenting
  in PC and trying to be better at using it. Growing up I followed this path and started learning about IT in general and now currently learning to be a Full Stack Developer.
